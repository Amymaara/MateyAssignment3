#Speaker:{Name}
The sky is grey.

Not storm grey — a diffent kind of grey.

The kind that makes it known something unsettling is about to happen.

Everything’s too quiet. Even the wind feels like it’s waiting for something.

We’re close. I can feel it.

#Speaker:Stu  
"Squaaak — it’s too still. I hate it. I hate it."

#Speaker:{Name}
"You and me both."

I grip the railing. Somewhere beneath us, the water shifts. 

Something *massive* stirs in the deep.

The crew starts gathering one by one. No orders needed.

Pearl clutches a small satchel of seashells, like a talisman.

#Speaker:Pearl  
"I can feel her pain, It's unbearable."

#Speaker:{Name}  
"The Kraken?"

#Speaker:Pearl  
"No — the ocean. She’s scared."

Shad emerges from the galley, dual-wielding a frying pan and a lemon.

#Speaker:Shad  
"Alright team! Either we die heroes or I make the best calamari stew the world’s ever seen."

#Speaker:Ravynn  
"Focus. This  unlike anything we’ve faced. If you hesitate, we all die."

#Speaker:Master Porthole  
"Mm. Uplifting. Remind me to invite you to my next gala."

#Speaker:Ravynn  
"Remind me to bring a harpoon."

#Speaker:{Name}

I almost smile. Almost.

 
"Listen up. We don’t know what’s happening next but we know eah other."

"We’ve been through storms, possible sabotage, arguments, a stolen whisk, and more emotional damage than I care to admit."

#Speaker:Stu  
"Don’t forget the time Shad almost poisoned us with his french toast ."

#Speaker:Shad  
"Hey! Those tasted great ignoring the side effects."

#Speaker:{Name}  
"Listen! This is it. No more running. No more hiding. We end this or the sea ends us."

The water starts to bubble.

Pearl gasps.

Master Porthole tightens his grip on his blade.

Ravynn whispers something under her breath. 

I step forward, heart hammering, palms sweating.

"All hands on deck! Let’s show the Kraken what we’re made of!"

The ship shakes as a roar echos from bellow.

Tentacles breach the surface.

The sky cries.

The sea screams.

And we fight.

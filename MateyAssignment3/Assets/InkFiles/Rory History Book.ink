=== history_flirty ===

#Speaker:{Name}
The red leather cover practically begs to be opened. I don't know what's heavier, the pages or the implications.

#Speaker:{Name}
I hear Master Porthole's soft voice behind me.

#Speaker:Master Porthole
"That's not just history to me, you know? It's everything I plan to do differently."

#Speaker:{Name}
"So... like strategic bedtime reading?"

#Speaker:Master Porthole
"A roadmap, written by tyrants. I plan to correct it, one imperial mistake at a time."

#Speaker:{Name}
"Sounds personal."

#Speaker:Master Porthole
"Everything worth fighting for always is."

#Speaker:{Name}
I close the book gently, like it's a sacred tome.

=== history_disinterested ===

#Speaker:{Name}
"This book practically screams theatrics at me."

#Speaker:{Name}
He replies flatly.

#Speaker:Master Porthole
"Something about it amuse you, Captain {Name}?"

#Speaker:{Name}
"It's just... a lot of drama for something with footnotes."

#Speaker:Master Porthole
"Why bother touching it, or talking about it â€” if it bores you?"

#Speaker:{Name}
He snatches the book from my hands, just a little too quickly.

#Speaker:{Name}
He turns away before I can respond.
